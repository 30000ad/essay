# Consider The Future

The above lines open the movie Ghost in the Shell (1995), a much-loved cult classic anime feature film for its gritty and harrowing depiction of what we call a “cyberpunk” world. It sets up the viewer to imagine not the future, but the ​*near future*​, one that appears to approach us, to become nearer, every day. The statements that begin the film's story ring true to us in each present moment: “Despite great advancements in computerization, countries and races are not yet obsolete...” The film, backed by a beautifully heartbreaking soundtrack, is full of long, pensive views of this ​*near future*​. Its visually striking nature is inspirational to say the least, and the surface elements of this film tend to be rightfully lauded as groundbreaking.

But the film also reflects a broader attitude that began to quickly take form in the post-Cold War era: two competing visions of the future were reduced to one, and while neither seemed to be the best of any world, the reality of a global, highly advanced and computerized corporate society seemed all but inevitable. This film, along with many other cultural media that debuted in the same decade, forces its audience to grapple with the ​*near future*​. It’s ever-present in the writing of the film. The characters, feeling full of nihilism and empty of hope, go about their duties as state actors for the sake of their own survival and, importantly, their pursuit of what this future promised them in the first place: the fullest expression of the self.

It quickly begins to delve into the politics of the body. Most of the people depicted in the film have some sort of physical and/or mental cybernetic upgrade. They’re able to transform their bodies, and while a privileged few are allowed to do so for the sake of self-exploration and autonomy, most do so because it’s a matter of surviving the crushing systemic symptoms of this future, in many cases, these transformations of the body optimize and specialize their labor value. One symptom folds in on itself onto another: the problem of maintenance. The violent systems of the *near future* are responsible for the functioning of technologies, which are simultaneously threatening their livelihood as well as providing them with the means to survive. As a Black transsexual woman, these themes deeply resonate with my own version of this reality, and as a dance music artist, they tend to make me... wonder.

## Consider the near future...

How long will my access to transgender care last? I’m faced with this question often. I rely on a complex web of transactional pharmaceutical networks to maintain my body. As of writing this, it’s apparent that supply chains could be the least of my worries: powerful, far-right political organizations aim to remove my access writ large. Without the availability of certain distribution networks or the guarantee of legal access to transition care, I could lose my own body. The *near future* is a bleak horizon to gaze upon.

Now let’s talk about dance music. Many have been familiarized with the origin story of house music and techno music over the past several years. These are the modern mediums of Black musical craft, but within them lies a much older message. As Black people, we have repeatedly lost our own bodies. There is rhythm to life, and so there is rhythm to death and everything in between. The cycles of slavery and the very conscription of race upon our flesh is itself a driving rhythm that strikes our spirit every moment of our waking lives. Many have been familiarized with the origin story of house music and techno music over the past several years, but not many have been told that these are the kick drums you’re listening to.

Consider the *near future* as a young Yoruba woman departing from a slave ship in Mississippi. Consider the *near future* as a Black freedom fighter– grandchild of that Yoruba woman– as they face down a mob of angry white men with rope and torches. Consider the *near future* as a houseless Black man on the subway, begging for help or food or water or something. The *near future* is a bleak horizon to gaze upon. Our aspiration is not of the ​*near future*​, it is of ​*THE FUTURE*​. It is the only horizon we have been allowed to gaze upon, and we choose to stand upon it.

## Consider the future...

For generations, we as Black people have designed rhythms to name the present and bring forth ​*THE FUTURE*​. The founders of the music we call techno were inspired by the advancements in self expression provided by new musical technology. They imagined a future beyond the near, new worlds full of free Black people, full of bodies that have not been lost to oppressors but instead found through a self-determined life, a true journey of self discovery and expression. A Black, trans future. In essence, we are projecting our people beyond the shackles of the ​*near future*​.

This is why *THE FUTURE* is ours. As is its music.

And so we found ourselves at a crucial stage. As we built towards this project, Black dance music was stolen, its connection of the Black experience severed, situating what was left as symbols of the ​*near future*​. As a result, today music of the ​*near future*​ situates itself alongside our music. It is uplifted and given a wide audience as it erases our message. Our rhythms of the present, our “space ships” that launch us beyond the trappings of what we already know to be an old world, they hold immense power. It is no wonder they’ve been repurposed to constrict our movement. It is not the actions of one or even a few people that have caused this to happen. It is simply the rhythm of the old world speaking.

In an irony, what our techno music founders imagined might be already considered a newly lost future, and this state of affairs haunts dance music. The rhythms its colonizers attempt to recreate sound more like a curse than a message. The colonial proliferators of our dance music have failed to consider *THE FUTURE* because they have never believed in any time beyond the ​*near future*​. Our space ships don’t fly in their apocalyptic skies. They’ve also failed to consider, however, that we’ve only just begun.

## Consider the far future...

Within the vehicle of the Afro-Surreal, we strive to look beyond ​*THE FUTURE*​ while simultaneously superimposing the ever-growing past. While there is a tendency of Afro-Surrealists to position themselves against the premises of Afro-Future, the potential that these two ideas are not diametrically opposed but rather related to an unfolding process— that is *THE FUTURE* and *RIGHT NOW* are, paradoxically, inhabitants of one another— is a project worth investigating. Superimposing these ideas is a movement, a spiral, that occupies an endless spectrum of dimensions. Even to depict this movement of just one higher dimension into our understanding of three dimensional space produces an articulation of this relationship:

We may call this new relationship of unfolding the ​*far future*​, a time consisting of recurring events that lead to obscurity, that is a past event that reoccurs yet does not result in the same progression as that of history. In the same breath, we occupy obscurity that leads itself into the past, what we might consider a *retelling* ​*of the future-past*​. This phenomenon as an experience can be described, simply, as ​*music*​.

Consider the ​*far future*​. The *near future* contains only the shackles of the finite. It is the total reduction of our imagination, a placement within “the inferno of same”, the destruction of individuation, delineation; it is the utmost form of dehumanization. We must inhabit the ​*far future*​, and in doing so we are, by nature of being inhabitants of the ​*far future*​, breaking free. This, to me, is the deepest definition of a ​*musical encounter*​. It is not merely the experience of sound communicating with and transforming the body, it is the spiraling portal, the lucid moment in which we witness *THE FUTURE* happening *RIGHT NOW.*
